Problem
JJ gives you a number NN and challenges you to construct a permutation PP of length NN such that:

|P_{i + 1} - P_i| \ge 2∣P 

 ∣≥2 for all 1 \le i \le N - 11≤i≤N−1 (Here |x|∣x∣ denotes the absolute value of xx)
Can you complete JJ's challenge?

As a reminder, a permutation of length NN is an array where every integer from 11 to NN occurs exactly once.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer TT — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains one integer NN — the length of the permutation PP to be constructed.
Output Format
For each test case, output NN space-separated integers P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_NP 

  denoting the permutation PP which satisfies the given conditions.

If no such permutation exists, output -1−1.

If there are multiple answers, print any.
